# Smart-Calendar

How to be on time every time? Moving around big cities is no easy matter because of the numerous people living around the area. A fixed alarm is often used to let you know about an upcoming event, but it does not provide a reliable departure time. Ideally, we should consider not only the current time and travel duration but also traffic conditions.

This project demonstrates how to build a device capable of solving this issue. The Smart Calendar gets the userâ€™s current location and destination to obtain the travel duration, including traffic time. Then, with this data, it calculates at which time the user should leave to be on time.
